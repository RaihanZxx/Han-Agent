> HanAgent isn't just a chatbot. It's a digital collaborator that lives in your workspace. It understands your goals, breaks them down into actionable steps, interacts with your files, executes commands, and learns from the results. If it hits an error, it tries to fix it. If it succeeds, it moves on.

## ‚ú® Key Capabilities

*   **Autonomous Planning**: Creates detailed, step-by-step plans before executing a task.
*   **Full Filesystem Access**: Can create, read, write, and manage files and directories within its secure workspace.
*   **Command Execution**: Runs shell commands (`python`, `git`, `javac`, `gradle`, etc.) to build, test, and run code.
*   **Self-Correction**: Analyzes `stdout` and `stderr` from commands to debug and retry on failure.
*   **Modular Knowledge**: Easily extend its expertise by adding simple `.txt` instruction files in the `prompt/` directory.
*   **Interactive Loop**: You can watch it work, and it will ask for clarification if it gets stuck.

## üß† The Core Loop: Plan, Execute, Reflect

HanAgent operates on a continuous feedback loop:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Plan: Analyzes the user's request. If it's a task requiring tools, it generates a detailed, step-by-step plan.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Execute: It takes the first step of its plan and calls the necessary tool (e.g., write_file or execute_command).

3Ô∏è‚É£ Reflect & Debug: It carefully examines the output of the tool. Was there an error? Is the output what was expected? Based on this reflection, it decides whether to try a different approach, modify its plan, or continue to the next step.

üîÅ Iterate: The loop continues until the task is marked TUGAS SELESAI or it requires human intervention.

üîß Extending the Agent's Knowledge

HanAgent's power comes from its modular prompts. You can teach it new skills without changing any code.

Simply add a new .txt file to the prompt/ directory. For example, to make the agent an expert in deploying with Docker, you could create _docker_guide.txt with your specific instructions and best practices. The agent will automatically load and incorporate this knowledge into its "brain" on the next run.
